What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

i get an empty repository. need this step to actually get a repository



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

it is a middle area to confirm the files that i want to make a commit with. i can specify the files that i want to commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

i can use git add and check that i have made only one logical change before commiting by using git diff
