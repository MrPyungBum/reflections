When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when i want share a profect with other people online


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you not want to share it with the commits that you have made


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork : making a same copy in github. doesnt change the original one
clone : making a copy in github from my local repository
branch : making a branch of commits in a repository
