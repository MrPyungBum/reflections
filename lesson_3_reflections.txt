Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork : making a same copy in github. doesnt change the original one
clone : making a copy in github from my local repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

because remote repository can be modified by other person or by myself in other devices
